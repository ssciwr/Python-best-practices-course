# Python-best-practices-course
Material for the course "Python best practices", Scientific Software Center, Heidelberg University

Inga Ulusoy, October 2022

Python has rapidly advanced to the most popular programming language in science and
research. From data analysis to simulation and preparation of publications, all can be done in
Python with appropriate libraries and implementing own modules. We will discuss Python
Enhancement Proposals (PEP) and how these can help you write cleaner code. Common
pitfalls in Python will be explained with examples. We will demonstrate typical “bad
programming” and how to code the examples in a more pythonic way.

## Prerequisites
Basic Python knowledge is required. Participants need a laptop/PC with camera and
microphone.

## Learning objectives
After the course participants will be able to
- Understand the basic PEP recommendations
- Use a linter and code formatter to ensure following of the guidelines
- Write better=more readable code
- Avoid bugs through best practices for example in passing keyword arguments

## Time and place
The course takes place online. A link will be sent to all registered participants.
